# Dashboard
Extracting information more intuitive by visualization using dashboard

I have created dashboard to alleviate grasping informating by visualization using dash which runs on flask framework. I have shown which category is preferred by pubic and how many persons have opted and how much revenue is made.

Used Modules:

dash: It is a Python framework for building analytical web applications and does not require javascript and built on top of Plotly.js, React and Flask. It ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical python code. I have used it for building dashboard for showing data insight for keneddy space center from year 2011 to 2014. The dashboard helps to find which package has been opted most by the user and which package incurs more revenue among others.

plotly: It provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for individuals and collaboration, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, Arduino, and REST. I have used it to plot bar and pie chart with an association of dash
